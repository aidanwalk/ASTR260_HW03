Problem 1: 
Run problem_1.py by executing python problem_1.py. This will generate two .txt files titled problem_1_1_data.txt and problem_1_2_data.txt in the local directory. 
Then run plot_problem1_1.py by executing python plot_problem1_1.py. This will diplay a plot of the overlay of the analytical derivative (black), the forward difference method (cyan), and the central difference method (magenta). 
Run plot_problem1_2.py by executing python plot_problem1_2.py. This will generate a graph of the error as a function of h when the derivative is evaluated at x = 0 (for a range of h = 00001 to .1 with a step size of .00001). The red line represents the error of the forward difference method and the black line represents the error of the centeral difference method. The y-axis is the associated local truncation error of each method, that is calculated by: f''(x)*h/2

Problem 2:
DO NOT RUN problem_2.py. I could not get this function work and was plauged with errors. Sorry I did not ask you about it in advance for help, I only started on it last night after class. Please just review this file and maybe we can go over what I did wrong here.
